# Hardware-Hack
Hardware simulation Of a Door Locking Password System on Proteus

The project is based on 8051 microcontroller. The C Program is the logic based on which it works

# Working :
* The project is a simple home door locking system
* When correct password is entered the 8051 microcontroller runs the motor in Clockwise dirn simulating the opening of a door.
* After 5 secs the door closes
* An LCD display shows the instructions or the current process
